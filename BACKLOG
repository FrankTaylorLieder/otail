otail Backlog

- Share line data using Arc<String> - reduce copying
- Move around views by %
- Show spooling progress on filter view.
- Publish v0.1 on crates.io - rename to ttail
- Make reader just return metadata and not the line data. Do all reads from ifile.
  - We spend a lot of effort duplicating the content on spooling without using it.
- Colour lines based on filter searches
- Enable multiple filters
- Enable structured format lines (e.g. CSV, json)
- Soft line wrapping
- Unit tests
