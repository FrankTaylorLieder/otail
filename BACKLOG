otail Backlog

- Share line data using Arc<String> - reduce copying
- Move around views by %
- Optimise spool progress, don't send stats for every line. But need to ensure
  latest file_lines is still sent.
- Make reader just return metadata and not the line data. Do all reads from
  ifile.
  - We spend a lot of effort duplicating the content on spooling without using
    it.
- Enable multiple filters
- Enable structured format lines (e.g. CSV, json)
- Soft line wrapping
- Unit tests
